# PasswordGenerator
So, in order to build my PG I started by pseudocoding the criteria I was asked to follow. I created variables and conditionals to test if the logic would work. After that, I added the function to generate the password. I made a "while loop" to show an alert until the criteria for the password length would be met. Then, I added the conditionals for the rest of the requested criteria (numbers, special characters, upper and lowercase letters, made another loop.
For the last part I gave the variables a value and conditionals.
